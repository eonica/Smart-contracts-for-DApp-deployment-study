# Smart-contracts-for-DApp-deployment-study

This repository includes the smart contracts code for the two use cases in the DApp deployment study submitted to the 5th International Workshop on Distributed Infrastructure for Common Good - DICG 2025.
These are as follows:

- the e-voting DApp use case:
  Vote.sol (lightweight contract for hashed vote information commitment to the ledger, complementary to external storage of extended vote data)

- the supply-chain DApp use case:
  SupplyChain.sol (main contract including lightweight functions for commitment of operational flow tracking information to the ledger)
  Utils.sol (contract module including modifiers for role checks and other common data used in the main contract)
